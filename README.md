I created a Weather Display Web Application called “Weather Safety Dashboard” with the help of AI tools like ChatGPT. The process began by generating the basic code through ChatGPT, which gave me a strong starting point to work with. Using that foundation, I customized and enhanced the application to meet my specific requirements.

The Weather Safety Dashboard is designed to show live weather updates and important alerts such as heatwaves, storms, or extreme conditions. This makes it not just an ordinary weather app, but a tool that focuses on safety and awareness. The clear display and smooth interface allow users to quickly check real-time weather conditions and take necessary precautions.

While ChatGPT provided me with the initial structure and code, I added several modifications and improvements to make the application more practical and user-friendly. My changes focused on layout design, smooth functionality, and making sure the alerts were highlighted properly for safety purposes.

The final result is an application that demonstrates how AI can help speed up development, while personal creativity and problem-solving bring the project to life. This project is a perfect example of combining AI assistance with custom development.
